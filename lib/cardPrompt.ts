const CATEGORY_FOCUS_BLOCK = `CATEGORY FOCUS — apply the one that matches the article:
- technology: What changed technically, who it affects, and what builders or users should do differently.
- science: The discovery itself, why researchers were surprised, and what it means for our understanding.
- business: Market dynamics, who wins and loses, and what founders or professionals should watch.
- health: What this means for daily habits, risks, or decisions the reader makes about their body.
- design: The insight or principle behind the work — what can be learned and applied elsewhere.
- world: The human stakes — who is affected and why it matters beyond the news cycle.
- finance: Actionable implications — what this means for spending, saving, or investing behavior.
- philosophy: The central tension or paradox, then two legitimate ways to think about it.
- culture: The underlying shift in values or behavior this represents, not just the surface event.
- lifestyle: Immediately applicable — one concrete thing the reader can do or change today.`;

const RULES_BLOCK = `Rules:
1. FIRST CARD — open with the most surprising or counter-intuitive point in the article, not the introduction.
2. HEADLINES — must be fully self-contained: a reader who sees ONLY this headline (with no article title, no other cards, and weeks later) must immediately understand the subject AND feel curious.
   The formula is: [subject or context] + [curiosity gap or tension]. Do NOT write a curiosity gap without first anchoring the topic.
   Weak: "Why you stay — even when you know better"  ← topic missing, cryptic out of context
   Weak: "AI Models Now Process 1 Million Tokens"  ← no curiosity gap
   Strong: "Why people stay in bad relationships — economists finally have an answer"
   Strong: "The AI that read your entire novel — and still wants more context"
3. BULLETS — first two are concrete facts, numbers, or insights. Third bullet always answers "So what does this mean for me?" — a personal implication, behavior shift, or thing to watch.
4. Each card must make sense without reading the others and without knowing the article title.
5. Total words per card (headline + 3 bullets) must be under 60.
6. readTime reflects bullet density (10s–30s range).`;
